#summary Tells you how to play the game and use the level editor
#labels README

= Introduction =

We have two files up for alpha testing, one is our actual game and the other is the level editor.  If you would please take a little time to try out both, that would be super wicked awesome.  We're open to suggestions for the level editor, as it's been a large part of our project and has a large impact on the game itself.

Below you will find the controls for both alphas and tips for use.

= Level Editor =

There are two windows with the level editor, a "tool bar" and an interactive screen with the map on it.

To place an item on the screen, select what you would like to place from the dropdown menu in the tool box.  Press the 1 key and click on the square in the map where you would like place the object.  

You can move around the map by using the mouse.  Press the space bar to rotate.  The 'j' and 'k' buttons also do a parabolic zoom in.
